This project uses a dataset containing video game sales for over 16,500 games, this data set can be found on Kaggle. Data set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales.

This project has everything from data cleaning, exploration, transforming data, and visualizing the data. I used Excel for this whole entire project from start to finish.
Some of the stuff you can find in the project is the use pivot tables/charts to display a large amount of visualizations anywhere from bar, pie, histogram and line. 

The pivot tables were the main tool used in this analysis, it was able to sort and format the data that I needed for the visaulizations.
The dashboards are simple but cleanly made and it was my first attent at using excel to do so.

Im proud of how the analysis came out and it gave me a lot of insight on how to create data projects from the cleaning to the visualizing.
